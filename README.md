# AutomationTask_Dropdown
This Repository contains automated test cases to add Sweden to the countries list on the signup page. 
I have used the Robot framework to automate the functional test cases for adding Sweden to the countries dropdown.
Robot Framework is a generic open-source automation framework and is widely used to automate the test cases for web UI. 
Below are the instructions for installing Robot Framework and setting up the environment for test automation.
1. Install Python 
2. Install Pycharm
3. Install the Robot Framework
4. Install the Selenium library
5. Install Webdriver for the browser ( chrome in this case)

After successfully installing the framework, I connected the test files to Git Hub for version control.

There are 3 robot files in the repository AutomationTask_Dropdown and are as below:

TC01.robot - This test case is to verify that Sweden Is in the country Dropdown list.
TC02.robot - This is a test case to verify that all expected countries are present in the Dropdown list. It is a part of the regression test scenarios.
TC03.robot - This is a test case to verify that Sweden can be selected and the form can be submitted.

There is a possibility of adding more scenarios for regression testing, but due to time constraints and some technical challenges, I have automated only the above ones.
